# Natural-Language-Question-Answering-System

Natural Language Question Answering is a challenging task in the field of Natural Language Processing . The crux of effective QA lies in the model's ability to comprehend both the question and the context in which it arises. To tackle this challenge, we utilized the Stanford Question Answering Dataset , a benchmark dataset for machine reading comprehension.
Our primary objective was to build models capable of bridging the gap between questions and their corresponding contexts, enabling accurate QA. We embarked on a journey of model exploration, comparing traditional recurrent-based architectures against the newer transformer-based models to determine the most effective approach.
